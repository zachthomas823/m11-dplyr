# Exercise 2: Data Frame Practice with `dplyr`.
# Use a different appraoch to accomplish the same tasks as exercise-1

# Install devtools package: allows installations from GitHub
# install.packages('devtools')

# Install "fueleconomy" package from GitHub
# devtools::install_github("hadley/fueleconomy")

# Require/library the fueleconomy package
library(fueleconomy)

# Install (if you haven't already) and load the `dplyr`package
# install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

# You should have have access to the `vehicles` data.frame


# Create a data.frame of vehicles from 1997
my.vehicles <- filter(vehicles, year == 1997)

# Use the `unique` function to verify that there is only 1 value in the `year` column of your new data.frame
unique(my.vehicles$year)

# Create a data.frame of 2-Wheel Drive vehicles that get more than 20 miles/gallon in the city
two.wheel.drive <- filter(vehicles, cty > 20, drive == "2-Wheel Drive")

# Of those vehicles, what is the vehicle ID of the vehicle with the worst hwy mpg?
worst.hwy.mpg <- filter(two.wheel.drive, hwy == min(hwy))

# Write a function that takes a `year` and a `make` as parameters, and returns 
# The vehicle that gets the most hwy miles/gallon of vehicles of that make in that year
best.hwy.mpg <- function(year_, make_) {
  vehicle.make.year <- filter(vehicle, make == make_, year = year_)
  return(filter(vehicle.make.year, hwy == max(hwy)))
}

# What was the most efficient honda model of 1995?
best.honda.1995 <- best.hwy.mpg(1995, "Honda")
